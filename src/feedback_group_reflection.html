              <h4 class="entry-title">From Quyen</h4>
              <p>
                Mai: Mai is a thoughtful and responsible friend in everything. She always knows how to help everyone on the team and lead a team, especially Mai's ability to write essays in English is the most outstanding in the group. Mai doesn't like to joke at work, so sometimes I feel that she's too serious.
                <br/><br/>
                Quyen: I find my strength to know more skills than others like web coding skills or GitHub. Hence I help everyone with web work and git-flow. Also, I am a responsible person for the job, so I always meet and submit articles on time. Besides, I feel that I am very hot-tempered and do not compromise easily with everyone's opinions unless they give me enough evidence and data to convince me. Therefore, I think I'm the member that is hard to get along with everyone because they might think I'm too conservative, in my opinion.
                <br/><br/>
                Loi: Loi has a very gentle personality. He is very easy to get along with everyone. Loi always respects everyone's opinion and is responsible for the job. However, Loi's English essay writing ability needs to be improved a lot.
                <br/><br/>
                Long: Long is very funny, easy-going, and very responsible at work. Long always respects others' opinions and always is on time for the deadline. However, it would be better if Long was actively contributing more ideas in the group meetings.
              </p>
              <br />

              <h4 class="entry-title">From Long</h4>
              <p>
                Loi: Loi is a person who loves to work along but he alway on time. He does not talk too much but he did very well at his job. However, he needs to show his idea for us to easily understand.
                <br/><br/>
                Quyen: Quyen is very good at her knowledge in IT. She brings a lot of ideas for the project. Moreover, she helps us with many things in the project. She is very well of all things.
                <br/><br/>
                Mai: Mai is a very kind person. She alway pushes us to work well and on time at group deadlines. Moreover, she takes care of everybody in the team and asks us to see if we need help.
                <br/><br/>
                Long: I try to do my best to finish and listen to every person. I have to do better than I am working now because I am not good at any specific skill. I have to learn more from my team.
              </p>
              <br />

              <p>
                For My own Perception: I think I have done a great job in completing the assigned work, besides I like to help the team members complete their work. However, my hot-tempered and conservative nature needs to be improved to make it easier to get along with everyone. I noticed that everyone was quite surprised by my ability to code the web and use GitHub. I learned a lot from everyone in the team, but what I like the most is the careful, thoughtful, and thoroughness in everything.
                <br/><br/>
                For Group: I feel fortunate to be able to work with all of my team members. We have completed the assigned work meticulously and responsibly. Everyone divided the work fairly and completed it on time. No one is absent from the group's meetings. However, I think it would be better to arrange more time to meet offline instead of online, so we will have more opportunities to get to know each other. I think everyone has learned a lot from each other after three weeks of working together. Currently, I think that my team has not taken full advantage of the Github log activity because the majority of team members are new to this tool. Although Github log activity is not enough to properly reflect the team members' capabilities and responsibilities in this assignment, we are still very active in using google doc to track the progress of all members.

                For my: I have finished everything on time to take my team flow. I have to learn a lot of things from my team.
                <br/><br/>
                For team: my team is very perfect that every person has their own ability. They have very good knowledge. Moreover, my team helps me every time when I am stuck at some work. This is the nicest team I ever see.
