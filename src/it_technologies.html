              <h4 class="entry-title">Definition, Current State, and Trends</h4>
              <p>
                Natural language processing (NLP) has lately received an awful lot of interest in representing and analyzing human language computationally. It has spread its packages in diverse fields such as gadget translation, email unsolicited mail detection, statistics extraction, summarization, medical, and question answering, and so forth. Dialogue systems or conversational structures consisting of chatbots, voice manipulate interfaces, and private assistants are examples of HCI (Human-computer interaction) software developed to engage with customers using natural language. Building a smart chatbot is difficult as it calls for contextual understanding, text entailment, and language-knowledge era. Consequently, various types of artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) are required.
                <br/><br/>
                AI targets to make conversation between human beings and computer systems easier by using natural language. However, the complexity of human communication has resulted within the need for AI scientists to offer fashions that can understand human language and the usage of the NLP approach. NLP is the vicinity of research that explores the capability of computers to recognize the human language. According to Vic Duan (2018), founder, and CEO at Acobot, Innovating Ecommerce with AI, four main points can be represented in state of the art in chatbots and NLP technology, which will show below.
                <br/><br/>
                Natural Language Understanding (NLU): Chatbots can process user input in a natural language and react appropriately. AI chatbots and click bots are both popular in the industry. However, while click bots can only communicate with users through buttons or select lists, a chatbot with NLU technology doesn't require developers to list all viable expressions of a given consumer enter. For example, with the ability to understand the various ways in communication such as "How do you pricing", the bot will recognize it as "What are your prices" and respond appropriately. Therefore, NLU is very important to AI chatbot performance.
                <br/><br/>
                Contextual Conversation: This central feature of AI chatbot is also known as a multi-round conversation. When the chatbot provides a reply, it considers not only the current user input but also previous user or bot messages. Contextual communication is crucial because, during the interaction, humans appear to rely on context to communicate knowledge. For example,
                • How's the weather in Ho Chi Minh now?
                • How about Ha Noi?
                • Raining too.
                • It's raining.
                In the second response, the bot considers its answer in the first question to output a different reply. Even though it is crucial to enhance the user experience by applying contextual conversation capability using many diverse methods, those methods are challenging to maintain and poor performance.
                <br/><br/>
                Memory: Many chatbots nowadays can memorize anything about users like name, gender, or age. Although it is fun and useful, they still have difficulty dealing with what they've spoken about with users. Vic Duan claims that the most challenging part is making use of the data in the chat logs storage.
                <br/><br/>
                Self-leaning: Anyone who has tried creating an AI chatbot would have felt the frustration of teaching a bot to answer questions. There are many questions users might ask, even though they visit a simple website or purchase a single product. Although AI chatbots can automatically communicate with end-users, building chatbots requires a great deal of manual work. The competent chatbots that can be used for business purposes are still too costly to be affordable.
                <br/><br/>
                Since most current work focuses on improving chatbot responses, we should explore the ability to interact using emotional and sentimental. Deep learning is a promising approach that could be applied to develop more effective chatbots. Additionally, the new AI chatbot generation should focus on using AI to create AI. For example, which can learn from the content, websites, and communicate with users in a completely autonomous way.
              </p>
              <h4 class="entry-title">Social Impact</h4>
              <p>Because of the intelligence and convenience, NLP technology and AI chatbots bring in many benefits to many sectors of life such as economics, healthcare, and education. For example, the chatbots can automatically answer questions and solve problems that guests do not require "direct" personnel. Also, with being supported by natural language processing, NLP (the thinking language programming), the group's chatbot can detect visitors ' behaviors and preferences in the time to make "super-personalized" recommendations to meet all customer needs. Chatbots are consistent with many business models, from the clinic to the hospital, from the pharmacy to the health care spa. Health care organizations can be set up for chatbots to answer customers and patients with information about common diseases, give advice and automate multiple everyday tasks. NLP technology and AI chatbot are applying wisely in Vietnam, also known as ELSA Speak. ELSA was constructed using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing ( NLP) to cater to various native languages. This app offers instant feedback while you're speaking and provides a thorough analysis.
                It lists the strengths and areas which need improvement. Thus, it all proves that NLP and AI chatbot will affect everyone, especially for business and educational people.

            <h4 class="entry-title">Personal Impact</h4>
            <p>NLP and AI chatbot have changed my behaviour in daily life. Starting in May 2018, VP bank launches AI chatbots, which new communication channels provide information about the promotion program, the card opening advice, reception of registration information, complaint complaints ... of customers. Therefore, it is useful for me to do bank service online and stay at home, which is good for everyone to avoid the Corona Virus. My friend and I are likely to use ELSA Speak for learning English. We often spend five hours per week learning on this platform. One of the most successful platforms that apply to NLP is Grammarly, it helps me every day in my writing and work from school. I also use Siri every day for setting the alarm, asking for a time zone, etc. Those benefits from this high technology are crucial for me because it brings me a lot of conveniences, making my life better.
