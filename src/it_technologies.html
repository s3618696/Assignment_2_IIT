              <h4 class="entry-title">Definition, Current State, and Trends</h4>
              <p>
                Natural language processing (NLP) has lately received an awful lot of interest in representing and analyzing human language computationally. It has spread its packages in diverse fields such as gadget translation, email unsolicited mail detection, statistics extraction, summarization, medical, and question answering, and so forth. Dialogue systems or conversational structures consisting of chatbots, voice manipulate interfaces, and private assistants are examples of HCI (Human-computer interaction) software developed to engage with customers using natural language. Building a smart chatbot is difficult as it calls for contextual understanding, text entailment, and language-knowledge era. Consequently, various types of artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) are required.
                <br/><br/>
                AI targets to make conversation between human beings and computer systems easier by using natural language. However, the complexity of human communication has resulted within the need for AI scientists to offer fashions that can understand human language and the usage of the NLP approach. NLP is the vicinity of research that explores the capability of computers to recognize the human language. According to Vic Duan (2018), founder, and CEO at Acobot, Innovating Ecommerce with AI, four main points can be represented in state of the art in chatbots and NLP technology, which will show below.
                <br/><br/>
                Natural Language Understanding (NLU): Chatbots can process user input in a natural language and react appropriately. AI chatbots and click bots are both popular in the industry. However, while click bots can only communicate with users through buttons or select lists, a chatbot with NLU technology doesn't require developers to list all viable expressions of a given consumer enter. For example, with the ability to understand the various ways in communication such as "How do you pricing", the bot will recognize it as "What are your prices" and respond appropriately. Therefore, NLU is very important to AI chatbot performance.
                <br/><br/>
                Contextual Conversation: This central feature of AI chatbot is also known as a multi-round conversation. When the chatbot provides a reply, it considers not only the current user input but also previous user or bot messages. Contextual communication is crucial because, during the interaction, humans appear to rely on context to communicate knowledge. For example,
                • How's the weather in Ho Chi Minh now?
                • How about Ha Noi?
                • Raining too.
                • It's raining.
                In the second response, the bot considers its answer in the first question to output a different reply. Even though it is crucial to enhance the user experience by applying contextual conversation capability using many diverse methods, those methods are challenging to maintain and poor performance.
                <br/><br/>
                Memory: Many chatbots nowadays can memorize anything about users like name, gender, or age. Although it is fun and useful, they still have difficulty dealing with what they've spoken about with users. Vic Duan claims that the most challenging part is making use of the data in the chat logs storage.
                <br/><br/>
                Self-leaning: Anyone who has tried creating an AI chatbot would have felt the frustration of teaching a bot to answer questions. There are many questions users might ask, even though they visit a simple website or purchase a single product. Although AI chatbots can automatically communicate with end-users, building chatbots requires a great deal of manual work. The competent chatbots that can be used for business purposes are still too costly to be affordable.
                <br/><br/>
                Since most current work focuses on improving chatbot responses, we should explore the ability to interact using emotional and sentimental. Deep learning is a promising approach that could be applied to develop more effective chatbots. Additionally, the new AI chatbot generation should focus on using AI to create AI. For example, which can learn from the content, websites, and communicate with users in a completely autonomous way.
              </p>
              <h4 class="entry-title">Social Impact</h4>
              <p>Because of the intelligence and convenience, NLP technology and AI chatbots bring in many benefits to many sectors of life such as economics, healthcare, and education. For example, the chatbots can automatically answer questions and solve problems that guests do not require "direct" personnel. Also, with being supported by natural language processing, NLP (the thinking language programming), the group's chatbot can detect visitors ' behaviors and preferences in the time to make "super-personalized" recommendations to meet all customer needs. Chatbots are consistent with many business models, from the clinic to the hospital, from the pharmacy to the health care spa. Health care organizations can be set up for chatbots to answer customers and patients with information about common diseases, give advice and automate multiple everyday tasks. NLP technology and AI chatbot are applying wisely in Vietnam, also known as ELSA Speak. ELSA was constructed using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing ( NLP) to cater to various native languages. This app offers instant feedback while you're speaking and provides a thorough analysis.
                It lists the strengths and areas which need improvement. Thus, it all proves that NLP and AI chatbot will affect everyone, especially for business and educational people.
            </p>
            <h4 class="entry-title">Personal Impact</h4>
            <p>NLP and AI chatbot have changed my behaviour in daily life. Starting in May 2018, VP bank launches AI chatbots, which new communication channels provide information about the promotion program, the card opening advice, reception of registration information, complaint complaints ... of customers. Therefore, it is useful for me to do bank service online and stay at home, which is good for everyone to avoid the Corona Virus. My friend and I are likely to use ELSA Speak for learning English. We often spend five hours per week learning on this platform. One of the most successful platforms that apply to NLP is Grammarly, it helps me every day in my writing and work from school. I also use Siri every day for setting the alarm, asking for a time zone, etc. Those benefits from this high technology are crucial for me because it brings me a lot of conveniences, making my life better.

              <h2 class="entry-title" style="color: palevioletred;">Blockchain & Cryptocurrencies (Mai)</h2>
              <h4 class="entry-title">Definition, Current State, and Trends</h4>
              <p>
                Blockchain is a data structure using cryptographic techniques and is managed by a peer-to-peer community where everybody, each acting as a node in this chain, must together reach an agreement in validating and creating new transactions which will be stored in a new block. The data stored in these blocks also cannot be changed without the consensus of this whole distributed network, thus it will prevent hackers from modifying the information stored here (Chowdhury 2019).
                <br/><br/>
                Cryptocurrencies are a form of virtual asset which is only created limitedly, and the most well-known type of cryptocurrencies is Bitcoin, utilizing blockchain to store its value (similar to traditional assets such as gold, stocks or real estate). The prices of cryptocurrencies are determined by their supply and demand in the market. Cryptocurrencies can be used in transactions via the Internet, equally to traditional currencies, and it can be sent directly from the account of one to another, which means there is no intermediary required to authorize these transactions. (Grabowski 2019).
                <br/><br/>
                The most prevalent application of blockchain nowadays is in the financial system. The most well-known application of blockchain, as aforementioned, is cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies, until now, have not been made to be legal in every jurisdiction around the world, since policy makers are still afraid of their risks of being used in illegal transactions for money laundering and terrorism (Library of Congress 2018).
                <br/><br/>
                Nevertheless, it is refutable that blockchain can help facilitate transactions of stocks, bonds, and derivatives in the financial markets. It provides digital payments and means of exchange cryptocurrencies such as Wirex, an e-wallet that supports the payment and exchange of both traditional and cryptocurrencies. Recently, Mastercard, a prominent payment service company has joined hands with Wirex to promote this new payment method via digital currencies, according to Browne (2020).
                <br/><br/>
                Blockchain is also used in the prediction marketplace system, where blockchain acts as an advisor to assist investors in predicting the future state of the market, and henceforth they can rely on these advice to trade shares, earn interest on market products such as oil, gas, or traditional currencies. The relevant examples here are Augur and Bitshares, both are digital tokens that apply PMS for users to trade based on the outcomes of future events (Casino et al. 2019).
                <br/><br/>
                Also, thanks to the transparency that blockchain brings to users, it has helped reduce costs to produce financial reports and financial auditing (Casino et al. 2019).
                <br/><br/>
                This technology is utilized in integrity verification as well, in which the system will store the data about lifetime information and transactions related to the formation of a product or a service: Blockchain has already been deployed for intellectual property protection (Ex: Mediachain, a database which helps creators claim and save their intellectual property rights) and for identity management (Ex: Shocard, a company which provides solutions to ease the complexity in “Know your customer”) (Casino et al. 2019).
                <br/><br/>
                Another field in which blockchain is nurturing is IoT, Internet of Things. Blockchain provides a way to secure data exchanged between interconnected devices, enhance their synchronization and their efficiency when operating in a decentralized and automated network (Ex: Blockpass, an application powered by blockchain technology to simplify the process of verification for humans, objects and connected devices when using different applications) (Jain 2018 & Chain of Things n.d.)
                <br/><br/>
                In businesses, many crowdfunding organizations have been seen to apply blockchain technology. The case of Swarm, Lighthouse and bitFyler can be mentioned here where they are all using blockchain to build their platforms (Casino et al. 2019). Another sector which is witnessing the rapid growth of blockchain is supply chain management, as the technology helps expand the value chains by developing trust between stakeholders, detecting counterfeit products, reducing paper works and the intervention of intermediaries.
                <br/><br/>
                The solution provided by Riddle & Code to enhance the security in logistics illustrated in Figure 1 can best describe how blockchain can guarantee the transparency and information security in this field:
                <div style="text-align:center">
                  <img src="../images/Mai/Riddle & Code.png" alt="">
                </div>
                <br/><br/>
                Despite the fact that more and more people are aware of the usefulness of blockchain and apply it in their businesses, it is still far from perfect for blockchain to be widely used since it remains several issues which hinder the way entrepreneurs can deploy this technology on a large scale.
                <br/><br/>
                The first problem of blockchain is latency: each transaction of Bitcoin takes several minutes to process, due to the processing of each block and the security checks to eliminate double-spend attack, while it takes much more slower for traditional processing system of VISA to validate a transaction (Casino et al. 2019).
                <br/><br/>
                The second problem relates to the intensive power consumption that blockchain requires for the system to keep verifying transactions, since it costs about 15 million USD/day for mining Bitcoin (Krishnan et al. 2020). This leads to massive expenses to deploy and to maintain the capacity for the growing users, especially for small and medium enterprises (Golosova & Romanovs 2018).
                <br/><br/>
                The third problem of blockchain is scalability: when more nodes are added, the verification time will increase, and new blocks will have to be waiting for being validated. Notwithstanding, this issue can be tackled by Raiden Network Protocol, by which global consensus is not necessary because only the last on-chain transaction between each entity is charged a fee, other transactions can occur off-chain and require no fees. A network of payment channels between different entities can be established to utilize the inherent payment networks created so that the new channel does not have to be formed and thus reduces costs of using blockchain (Krishnan et al. 2020).
                <br/><br/>
                Giving such obstacles, blockchain is still believed to keep emerging in certain sectors. Insurance is a potential field for this technology to develop, as blockchain can help ease the process of validating claims in different types of insurance (Prabhakar et al. 2017).
                <br/><br/>
                Regarding the field of governance, blockchain-based applications can ease the process of managing public records as well as mitigating the risk of corruption and bureaucracy in the context of smart city through electronic voting and simplified procedure of taxation, claiming patent, and business registration.
                <br/><br/>
                With respect to the healthcare system, blockchain can be used to assure data security in managing healthcare records of patients (Casino et al. 2019).
                <br/><br/>
                With reference to education, blockchain can provide transparency in handling educational records to promote more equitable rewards (Casino et al. 2019).
                <br/><br/>
                Also, in businesses, there is still space for blockchain to evolve through ensuring illegal information disclosures through cross-organizational management and facilitating the selection process, increase the credential in applicant’s background, and ease the payroll procedure in human resources management (Wiles 2019).
              </p>
              <h4 class="entry-title">Social Impact</h4>
              <p>It is manifestly true that blockchain was born to promote decentralization in many fields such as the Internet and many public sectors which are currently being conquered by Internet Service Providers, the governments and other tech giants. With the ubiquity of blockchain in the future, corruption and monopoly may be reduced (Al-Saqaf & Seidler 2017).
              <br/><br/>
              Besides, companies which are acting as intermediaries in transactions will most likely be negatively affected as blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies will foster the peer-to-peer exchange, allowing direct interaction between sellers and consumers without the need of their intervention (Ertz & Boily 2019).
              <br/><br/>
              The way an organization is managed will also be changed: major decisions can be carried out without the involvement of the CEO by a new governance system called decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), powered by Ethereum, where the votes of the members in the organization can be updated real-time through smart contracts and therefore enables every member to express their opinions about certain issues in the organization (Lee 2019).
              <br/><br/>
              In the world of blockchain, the money supply will no longer be adjusted by the central bank, as there will be more than one type of currency in a country and the interest rate of each currency will rather be determined by its degree of risk than deliberate plan of the central bank (Anderson 2019).
              <br/><br/>
              It should also be mentioned that thanks to blockchain and cryptocurrencies, workers, especially those who are working for multinational corporations, will get paid more quickly and receive relatively higher wage as they can avoid the imbalance in exchange rate between different countries as well as the cumbersome paper works issued by the intermediary banks (Hartog 2019).
            </p>
            <h4 class="entry-title">Personal Impact</h4>
            <p>A world where no cash will be needed and there will also be no need for money exchange when travelling to a foreign country is visible when cryptocurrencies prevail. In such a world, when I rent a house, I will only have to pay a required number of crypto-tokens, and the owner will send me a key to unlock the smart electric locks via a cryptographically signed message to unlock the door. The paper works relating to money transfer with the involvement of banks will be eliminated (Christidis & Devestsikiotis 2016).
            <br/><br/>
            In the world dominated by block chain and IoT, if my car is low in fuel, it will automatically choose the nearest gas station for me to drive there and fill the petrol. The costs will be directly charged in my e-wallet since everything I own is linked to it. Also, if I am to lend the motorbike for my friend or my brother, they cannot use my e-wallet to fill up the tank because this system is customizable, and even in the case that I allow them to use my e-wallet, I can still track how much money they have used through the history transactions which cannot be made to change.
            <br/><br/>
            Also, my mother will not have to bother about prices and quality of goods when going to the market anymore: an app will calculate the best prices in every local groceries in the city, send the lists of goods she has chosen before to the retailers and they will send everything she needs to our home, and the bills will be automatically settled in my e-wallet (Huckle et al. 2016).
