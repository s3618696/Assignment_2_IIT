              <h2 class="entry-title" style="color: palevioletred;">Overview</h2>
              <p>The project will be an AI mobile app for growing food at home. This app acts like a farmer who will help the users choose the most suitable plants, provide them with instructions on how to take care of their plants step-by-step, and push notifications for reminding users to keep an eye on their plants.            </p>
              <br />

              <h2 class="entry-title" style="color: palevioletred;">Motivation</h2>
              <p>As we all know, the world is suffering from the Corona Virus. Growing fresh vegetables at home are met by people around the world during the execution of a social blockade or social dilation to prevent the translation of the Covid-19 disease. According to Quang Nam Online Newspaper, "The consumption of seeds is increased globally. In Russia, the demand for seed increased by 20%-30% in March compared to the same period last year." To support the need for clean vegetable farming, I came up with this idea of doing this project to help people in productive plants, effectively, through which they would increase interest in agriculture, improve health, and protect the environment.</p>
              <br />
              <h2 class="entry-title" style="color: palevioletred;">Description</h2>
              <h4 class="entry-title">Step 1: Preparation</h4>
              <p>
                Users can search for a plant or take a picture of the plant they want to grow. The app will help detect which type of the plant is, and output to the user plant name, plant description, as well as the best environment to grow the plant.
                <br/><br/>
                After users allow the app to access their location, the app will give the user advice on whether they should grow the vegetable depending on the location geography and weather.
              </p>
              <h4 class="entry-title">Step 2: Growing and Harvesting</h4>
              <p>
                  Based on the instructions, users will start growing their own plants and take pictures of the plants weekly, then submit them to the app. The apps will analyse the status of the plants according to the size, the colour, the shape of leaves, … and present a detailed planting roadmap for users on how to keep nurturing their plants in one week. For example:
                <br/>
                • Day 1: <br/>
                300 ml water (optimal time range: 6AM-7AM)<br/>
                30g sodium<br/>
                • Day 2:<br/>
                300 ml water in the morning (optimal time range: 6AM-7AM)<br/>
                Ensure that the surrounding temperature is 260C<br/>
                • Day 3:<br/>
                300 ml water in the morning (optimal time range: 6AM-7AM)<br/>
                20g nitrogen fertilizer<br/>
                • Day 4:<br/>
                300 ml water in the morning (optimal time range: 6AM-7AM)<br/>
                10g phosphorous<br/>
                • Day 5:<br/>
                300 ml water in the morning (optimal time range: 6AM-7AM)<br/>
                Ensure that the surrounding temperature is 260C<br/>
                • Day 6:<br/>
                300 ml water in the morning (optimal time range: 6AM-7AM)<br/>
                15g potassium<br/>
                • Day 7:<br/>
                300 ml water in the morning (optimal time range: 6AM-7AM)<br/>
                Ensure that the surrounding temperature is 260C<br/>
                <br/>
                Notifications will also be sent to users based on this roadmap to remind them to take care of the plants. Throughout weeks, tips to grow the plant better will also be sent to users and updated to the roadmap.
              </p>
              <h4 class="entry-title">Step 3: After Harvesting</h4>
              <p>When it is time for harvesting, the app will give users tips to recover the plants and provides a new roadmap to continue growing for the next harvesting.</p>
              <h4 class="entry-title">Additional Features</h4>
              <p>
                This app will also have a social media platform called Home Grow Community to post their plant processes, share their experiences or even trade their products with each other.
                <br/><br/>
                After this app is launched and able to gain a large number of users, we will install a new feature which recommends users a specific type of fertilizer or necessary gardening tool when growing their plants. This will allow brands of fertilizer and gardening utensils to promote their products to a wider pool of potential customers and in return, we will charge these brands for advertising fees as a financial resource to maintain this application.
              </p>
              <br/>
