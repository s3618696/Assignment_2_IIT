              <p>
                We are fortunate to have a chance to interview an IT professional, Mr. Kai, currently a project manager for a Singapore technology company. His company focuses mainly on AI-combined technology products. The company completed three major projects and launched in Silicon Valley two years ago, their current partner is Netflix and Verkada. Currently, the company is developing two AI projects in Vietnam to serve education primarily. The clients of these two platforms are the data scientists and developers. <br/>
                <br/>
                His daily jobs are to manage and communicate with a lot of people. Ten people are working under his command, including three frontends, three backends, two mobile developers, and two product developments. Besides, he has to work with a UX, UI design team as outsourcing. Moreover, due to the work nature of a project manager, he always has to talk, find out the need for market and customer, and then sum up all of that travel to visualize and give the product features. For the company's current products, the data scientist, the developers, and the business development of companies with management problems and processing data will be the main subject to which he has to talk every day. <br/>
                <br/>
                Kai said he spent most of his time at the meetings. He often comes to the company at 8 am every morning. The first thing he does is track everyone's work through a specialized management software built by his company. Then Kai does the scrum with the team every 8:30 am. Kai will arrange a time to call the facetime meeting with the clients and the companies to learn about their difficulties and needs. His assistant arranged the list he had to call that day, normally one day, he'd call about two or three calls. In addition to meeting with customers, he uses the time to design features and learn about the technologies used to build these features. He was also a developer as a student, so understanding the technology inside a product was not too difficult. After having a complete understanding and design, Kai will work with his team's CTO on what he just found out. They will discuss with each other to make a final decision for new features. He spent time watching the day reports of everyone in the team to keep track of their work progress while also assigning tasks for the team tomorrow.<br/>
                <br/>
                Kai said that his position is facing a lot of difficulties. But the biggest difficulty for him is to communicate with everyone on the team. Kai is a Singaporean who lives in Vietnam. He has to communicate with the team in English. All the staff on the team are Vietnamese. There are times when they can't get to know each other, or the team doesn't understand 100% of his requests that he wants them to do. He has always wanted to discuss and listen to everyone's opinions about the product, but sometimes he feels they don't share or sloth out their opinions because they don't know how to play it in English.
