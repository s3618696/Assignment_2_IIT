              <p>
                • Name: Khuc Thi Xuan Quyen <br />
                • Student number: s3618696 <br />
                • Like many teenagers, after graduating from high school, I decided to go to RMIT to study marketing and an expectation that marketing will help me to discover more of my potential and will bring me a great job after graduation. Unfortunately, after a year of learning in marketing, I felt that I was not born for this profession. I found myself very curious about everything, especially the thing that involves technology. My mind is always bothered by one question, which is HOW IT WORKS. After receiving some advice from the school, I decided to change my field to software engineering. In the second year at the software, I started my first job as a mobile developer for a Singapore company in Vietnam. My primary skill was Flutter and React native. A year later, my boss wanted me to try on building a web app with many combinations of React JS, Redux, and Graph QL. For now, I work as a front-end developer along with a project management trainee position. For that, I could not spend a lot of time for school, so I decided to change to IT, with an expectation that IT will save me a lot of time because my current work is IT as well. <br/>

              <h2 class="entry-title" style="color: palevioletred;">Ideal Jobs</h2>
              <h4 class="entry-title">Similarities</h4>
              <p>• Problem – Solving <br />
                • Communication <br />
                • Team building <br />
                • Analytical skill <br />
                • Planning <br />
                • Organization, critical thinking, research, management, negotiating skills, decision-making (technical project manager and business analyst) <br />
                • Creativity (IT Security Analyst and Software developer) <br />
                </p>
                <h4 class="entry-title">Differences</h4>
                <p>• Technical Project Manager must ensure the workflow and be responsible for the output of the team. Reporting, planning and quality assessment are the highly necessary skills for this job <br />
                    • Business Analyst: besides analytical skills, business analyst must also have good research skills to identify risks as well as opportunities to leverage the business performance. Moreover, business knowledge about prices, revenues, and profits is also needed for this position, beside technology-related ideas <br />
                    • IT Security Analyst: technology-related knowledge is required, as well as the ability to conduct test and detect for errors in the IT system. An IT Security Analyst does not need to know about business-related terminology as a business analyst does <br />
                    • Software Developer: coding skills are the core requirement of this job. Moreover, there is no need for a software developer to write report or research for business innovation as a technical project manager or a business analyst <br />
