                This is an incredible job. Some might say this position is crazy. I must be strong in communication, leadership, and technical skills. This position requires me to know about almost everything in the IT industry, either generic or specialized. Even though this position is the most challenging job for only me and everyone in the IT world, because of the results it brings, I still believe that this job is worth trying.

                My perspective of the ideal career will not change because I believe that skills in this career path may not differ in part from other professional or field skills standards. So it might be a little less difficult for me to try another field in the future, or to pursue a different career as a programmer, because I still have experience in the last workplace environment. At the same time, choosing this industry is the right decision when technology is at the forefront of human life development and the exploration of new fields. <br/>

                This is a great job that I want to do because I can make my own decisions for the app. I have to learn more in SQL, coding languages, and many soft skills to make the app more efficient and convenient. I think my opinion is my best choice because the IT industry is very demanding and developing that the software development field needs to make a best app for people.
